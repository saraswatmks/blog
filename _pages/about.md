Hola

I am a data scientist working for more than five years now. I like solving impactful problems because of the challenges they offer and learning opportunities one can discover along the way. I usually follow a three step framework while solving a problem: Feasability, Prototype and Production.

I've been mainly working on projects involving text data using deep learning. Some of the use cases I've worked on are:

* **Search Models**: Building models to enhance relevancy in search results
* **Recommendation Models**: Improving user discovery of products on a platform
* **Text Duplication**: Building a data product using open source technologies which can efficiently identify duplicate text.

Also, I am the author & maintainer of [superml](https://saraswatmks.github.io/superml/) R package. It helps people build ML models in R just like using scikit-learn. A lot of my weekend time goes in improving it.
